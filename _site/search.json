Generally, I utilize quality survey datasets such as GSS, NationScape, and the CES. At times, I will also scrape data from public sources to find insights.\nThis information is diseminated in a weekly blog out on Friday mornings usually with a new data figure to talk about.\nAbout me: I am a social scientist and data scientist. I have an undergraduate degree in political science and a masters in data science. I have worked in the political polling industry and, most recently, the marketing data science field the past several years. You can read more about me on my personal website.\nTerminology: Some latter-day saints may be concerned because my title isn’t the correct name of the church. However, this blog is about the entirety of the Mormon sect including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Community of Christ, and others. So, in reference to the name of the sect, I use the name “Mormon” in my blog and hence the title “Mormon Metrics.”"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nRecently, a few articles have come out about how Mormons are less favorable toward Donald Trump than previous Republican candidates. Specifically, they say the distaste still lingers here in 2024 and younger Mormons may be moving away more quickly than other younger folks. While we won’t dive into the age X party affiliation breakdown given our limited sample size with the GSS, let’s look at some overall trends.\n\n\nData\nThe data in this post is from the GSS which has data from 1978 to present. Unfortunately, due to the limited sample size of the GSS (having a few thousand respondents each wave), it can be difficult to see trends. For this chart, I combined the data by decade to try and see a trend. Each data point for mormons represent around 150-200 people, but it should be interpreted with caution as the respondents are spread out over a decade after all. The hope is that we will be able to see large shifts and trends for our question. Perhaps at a later date, I will use the CES data which has larger samples to look closer at some of these trends.\n\n\nChart\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Mormon Political Affiliation\n\n\nLet’s talk about some takeaways looking at our chart…\n\nIn the US overall, the number of true independents has increased ~7 percentage points since the 1980s taking from the Democratic party.\nFor Mormons, we see a similar trend with true independents increasing; however, Mormons who previously identified with both parties are leaving it seems.\nIf you look closely, you can see that Republicans are leaving at a twice the rate (-23pts) than Democrats(-12pts) since the 80s which supports some of the claims in the articles mentioned above.\n\nThough, it is important to remember to interpret these with caution as these Mormon datapoints are being combined over a decade with only ~ 175 people for each data point. I look forward to confirming these results with other datasets with a higher Mormon sample size.\n\n\nDiscussion\nWhy are more people identifying as independents? Why could this trend be especially pronounced among Mormons?\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus."

    "title": "Myth of Latter-day Saint Prosperity",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nAs a member of the LDS church, I have grown up hearing the claim although US Latter-day Saints make up only a small percentage of the population, we are disproportionally wealthy when compared to the US general population. I assume this is a common misconception, given the amount of times I have heard it, as well as something I believed myself. At some point, I came across an article regarding Mormons in the US. I would just refer you to that article and you could be on your way, but the data is from 2009 - which is almost 15 years ago now! What a perfect opportunity for me to bake up some yummy data snacks regarding the breakdown of Latter-day Saints by household income and how it has changed over time.\n\n\nThe Data\nUsing data from a large political survey project of 500,000 Interviews from 2019-2021, I was able to filter the sample to only Latter-day Saint respondents and ended up with a sample 6,452 members found across the United States. I used the same data source as a previous blog post I wrote up here if interested.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this household income figure, we can answer our our first question! In 2021, the LDS actually has larger lower and middle classes and has a smaller proportion of people in the highest income bracket than the rest of the population. Hopefully, this is enough to convince you that Latter-day Saints being proportionally wealthier is a myth.\nI included Jews for the sake of including a group that actually is proportionally wealthy, and the gap is large. According to our data, the Jews are more than twice as likely to be in the top income bracket than Latter-day Saints.\nNow lets look at how this trend has changed over the last 15 years…\nOur data source we used above is only for 2019-21, so we need to combine another source for this next graph. Pew Research Center publishes a religous landscape study that collects large sample sizes of most religious groups in the United States. For Latter-day Saints, there is a sample of around 500 for this study which was fielded in 2007 and 2014. From this, we can look at 3 snapshots of LDS income over the last 15 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt definitely looks like income is increasing over time among Latter-day Saints. In the 100k+ group, we see 16% to 20% then 29%. However, this doesn’t account for forces like inflation and how the overall US population has moved over the last 15 years. So let’s make another one, to see how income has changed compared to the general population\nSide note about the above figure: I find it interesting that the proportion of LDS people in the lowest income bracket has remained relatively stable over time. While we don’t have the data we need to safely make this claim, our graph could suggest that there is a slight income disparity growing within the church as the middle income bracket shrinks over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking now at the Latter - day Saint group over time, the percentage of households making 100k+ consistently remains lower than the overall population. Also, it seems that the gap between the overall population and Latter - day Saints is growing over time. In 2007, there is a 6 point difference and goes from 6 to 8 to finally 11. Perhaps not only are Latter-day saints below the average, but may even be getting poorer over time!\nLatter-day Saints are not a poor group overall (30% make 6-figures+!), this information just disputes the claim that Latter-Day Saints are proportionally wealthy.\n\n\nAppendix\nThe code that I used to analyze this data and create the graphs above are found on github. Please reach out with any questions or thoughts.\nFor futher enrichment of those interested, here is the graph with several more religions.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, of the religions we included here, Mormons are the least likely to make $100k+.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus."

I have always thought that BYU-Provo was the most difficult school to get into of the Mormon colleges, but I wanted to look at a few other schools to including BYU Hawaii and the eastern LDS-adjacent Southern Virginia University.\n\n\nData\nThe data in this post is from NCES which has a survey where US universities report data on various aspects of the college including admissions. If you explore the website, you can find numerous data sources about different aspects of the American education system from elementary school to high school and universities.\n\n\nChart\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Admission of LDS Colleges\n\n\nThough I would have loved to look back further, the NCES survey started recording admission data in 2014, so that’s what we have.\nA few findings…\n\nMore students are accepted into BYU-Provo now as compared to the past. In 2014, it was 50% and most recently is 67%.\nNumber of applicants to BYU-Idaho has increased over time though the acceptance rate has held constant.\nBYU-Hawaii accepts around the same amount of students each year, but the number that have applied has been a bit volatile in recent years.\nSVU has received a similar number of applicants over the years, but is now accepting almost all applicants compared to around 50% in 2014.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nHow does this track with what you have seen?

    "title": "Are Mormons Actually More Educated?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nI’ve been seeing a few places that the perception is that Mormons have a large middle class group “with above average education levels”, but after seeing some income data from Nationscape I was curious what nationscape data had for Mormon education levels. Because, in a previous post, we saw Mormon’s having a more modest salary compared to previous survey results.\n\n\nData\nThe data in this post is from the Nationscape which has data from 2019-2021. Because of the large sample sizes of the project, we are able to get a several thousand Mormon respondents (6452 to be exact) which is significantly higher than many other studies such as the religious landscape study by Pew Research Center.\n\n\nCharts\nPersonally, I think the “Mormons are more educated” idea lingers because the last time Mormons were prominently in the national US news was in 2012 when Mitt Romney ran for president.\n\n\n(My suspicion is confirmed in the google trends chart above.)\nJust after the first time Romney ran in 2008, Pew Research Center published a Mormon demographic profile which had findings showing a large middle class income bracket and higher than average education levels shown in the figure below:\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Mormon Income and Education Levels from 2009 (Pew)\n\n\nMy theory is that “mormons are more educated” and “have a strong income in the middle class” were picked up in large scale in 2012 from this report and cemented in people’s minds ever since.\nOne thing I’ll note about the Pew study is that with a sample size of around 500 you’ll have a margin of error of around +/- 5pts. Looking at the nationscape data and the 6500 respondents, that number drops to +/- 1pt according to this tool at least. So obviously, as our N size increase, our estimates are less error prone.\nNow lets look at Nationscape…\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Overall Education Levels with Nationscape\n\n\nOverall, Mormons don’t appear to be as educated as the average american with slightly more people not attending college. This isn’t a large gap as the majority of Mormon’s attend at least some college, but again, so do most people in the American population.\nIt’s possible this could be a trend where initially (2009) mormons were more educated and had more money, but recently have less money and are less educated compared to the US population. It also could be that some of the higher educated and higher income Mormons recently left the religion.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Education X Gender with Nationscape\n\n\nLooking specifically at the gender cut, unsurprisingly, the “some college” group is driven by women who perhaps dropped out of college after having children. As is the trend with the national, Mormon women are a bit more likely to be educated beyond high school than Mormon men.\nWhile these charts are interesting, I look forward to confirming these findings with other data sources.\n\n\nDiscussion\nDid you have the perception that American Mormons were more educated than the average American?\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus."

The Mormons today may look like over American families did 40 years ago. This is quite interesting as the US population has had many shifts on views of marriage during that this time period, but Mormons may not have been as affected or changed by these.\nCompared to the US population, Mormons are more likely to be married (especially more recently) and less likely to be “never married” or “widowed/divorced/separated.”\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nIn your opinion, why have Mormon demographics of marriage hardly changed over the last 40 years?\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus."
