    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nRecently, a few articles have come out about how Mormons are less favorable toward Donald Trump than previous Republican candidates. Specifically, they say the distaste still lingers here in 2024 and younger Mormons may be moving away more quickly than other younger folks. While we won’t dive into the age X party affiliation breakdown given our limited sample size with the GSS, let’s look at some overall trends.\n\n\nData\nThe data in this post is from the GSS which has data from 1978 to present. Unfortunately, due to the limited sample size of the GSS (having a few thousand respondents each wave), it can be difficult to see trends. For this chart, I combined the data by decade to try and see a trend. Each data point for mormons represent around 150-200 people, but it should be interpreted with caution as the respondents are spread out over a decade after all. The hope is that we will be able to see large shifts and trends for our question. Perhaps at a later date, I will use the CES data which has larger samples to look closer at some of these trends.\n\n\nChart\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Mormon Political Affiliation\n\n\nLet’s talk about some takeaways looking at our chart…\n\nIn the US overall, the number of true independents has increased ~7 percentage points since the 1980s taking from the Democratic party.\nFor Mormons, we see a similar trend with true independents increasing; however, Mormons who previously identified with both parties are leaving it seems.\nIf you look closely, you can see that Republicans are leaving at a twice the rate (-23pts) than Democrats(-12pts) since the 80s which supports some of the claims in the articles mentioned above.\n\nThough, it is important to remember to interpret these with caution as these Mormon datapoints are being combined over a decade with only ~ 175 people for each data point. I look forward to confirming these results with other datasets with a higher Mormon sample size.\n\n\nDiscussion\nWhy are more people identifying as independents?

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nAs a member of the LDS church, I have grown up hearing the claim although US Latter-day Saints make up only a small percentage of the population, we are disproportionally wealthy when compared to the US general population. I assume this is a common misconception, given the amount of times I have heard it, as well as something I believed myself. At some point, I came across an article regarding Mormons in the US. I would just refer you to that article and you could be on your way, but the data is from 2009 - which is almost 15 years ago now! What a perfect opportunity for me to bake up some yummy data snacks regarding the breakdown of Latter-day Saints by household income and how it has changed over time.\n\n\nThe Data\nUsing data from a large political survey project of 500,000 Interviews from 2019-2021, I was able to filter the sample to only Latter-day Saint respondents and ended up with a sample 6,452 members found across the United States. I used the same data source as a previous blog post I wrote up here if interested.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this household income figure, we can answer our our first question! In 2021, the LDS actually has larger lower and middle classes and has a smaller proportion of people in the highest income bracket than the rest of the population. Hopefully, this is enough to convince you that Latter-day Saints being proportionally wealthier is a myth.\nI included Jews for the sake of including a group that actually is proportionally wealthy, and the gap is large. According to our data, the Jews are more than twice as likely to be in the top income bracket than Latter-day Saints.\nNow lets look at how this trend has changed over the last 15 years…\nOur data source we used above is only for 2019-21, so we need to combine another source for this next graph. Pew Research Center publishes a religous landscape study that collects large sample sizes of most religious groups in the United States. For Latter-day Saints, there is a sample of around 500 for this study which was fielded in 2007 and 2014. From this, we can look at 3 snapshots of LDS income over the last 15 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt definitely looks like income is increasing over time among Latter-day Saints. In the 100k+ group, we see 16% to 20% then 29%. However, this doesn’t account for forces like inflation and how the overall US population has moved over the last 15 years. So let’s make another one, to see how income has changed compared to the general population\nSide note about the above figure: I find it interesting that the proportion of LDS people in the lowest income bracket has remained relatively stable over time. While we don’t have the data we need to safely make this claim, our graph could suggest that there is a slight income disparity growing within the church as the middle income bracket shrinks over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking now at the Latter - day Saint group over time, the percentage of households making 100k+ consistently remains lower than the overall population. Also, it seems that the gap between the overall population and Latter - day Saints is growing over time. In 2007, there is a 6 point difference and goes from 6 to 8 to finally 11. Perhaps not only are Latter-day saints below the average, but may even be getting poorer over time!\nLatter-day Saints are not a poor group overall (30% make 6-figures+!), this information just disputes the claim that Latter-Day Saints are proportionally wealthy.\n\n\nAppendix\nThe code that I used to analyze this data and create the graphs above are found on github. Please reach out with any questions or thoughts.\nFor futher enrichment of those interested, here is the graph with several more religions.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, of the religions we included here, Mormons are the least likely to make $100k+.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus."

    "title": "Are Mormons Actually More Educated?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nI’ve been seeing a few places that the perception is that Mormons have a large middle class group “with above average education levels”, but after seeing some income data from Nationscape I was curious what nationscape data had for Mormon education levels. Because, in a previous post, we saw Mormon’s having a more modest salary compared to previous survey results.\n\n\nData\nThe data in this post is from the Nationscape which has data from 2019-2021. Because of the large sample sizes of the project, we are able to get a several thousand Mormon respondents (6452 to be exact) which is significantly higher than many other studies such as the religious landscape study by Pew Research Center.\n\n\nCharts\nPersonally, I think the “Mormons are more educated” idea lingers because the last time Mormons were prominently in the national US news was in 2012 when Mitt Romney ran for president.\n\n\n(My suspicion is confirmed in the google trends chart above.)\nJust after the first time Romney ran in 2008, Pew Research Center published a Mormon demographic profile which had findings showing a large middle class income bracket and higher than average education levels shown in the figure below:\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Mormon Income and Education Levels from 2009 (Pew)\n\n\nMy theory is that “mormons are more educated” and “have a strong income in the middle class” were picked up in large scale in 2012 from this report and cemented in people’s minds ever since.\nOne thing I’ll note about the Pew study is that with a sample size of around 500 you’ll have a margin of error of around +/- 5pts. Looking at the nationscape data and the 6500 respondents, that number drops to +/- 1pt according to this tool at least. So obviously, as our N size increase, our estimates are less error prone.\nNow lets look at Nationscape…\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Overall Education Levels with Nationscape\n\n\nOverall, Mormons don’t appear to be as educated as the average american with slightly more people not attending college. This isn’t a large gap as the majority of Mormon’s attend at least some college, but again, so do most people in the American population.\nIt’s possible this could be a trend where initially (2009) mormons were more educated and had more money, but recently have less money and are less educated compared to the US population. It also could be that some of the higher educated and higher income Mormons recently left the religion.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Education X Gender with Nationscape\n\n\nLooking specifically at the gender cut, unsurprisingly, the “some college” group is driven by women who perhaps dropped out of college after having children. As is the trend with the national, Mormon women are a bit more likely to be educated beyond high school than Mormon men.\nWhile these charts are interesting, I look forward to confirming these findings with other data sources.\n\n\nDiscussion\nDid you have the perception that American Mormons were more educated than the average American?\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus."

    "title": "Where Are Missionaries Likely To Get Called?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nWhen I was 18 and graduating high school, I remember feeling overwhelmed by the possible places you could go on a mission. After all, missionaries get called to every continent (except Antarctica) going anywhere from large cities like Tokyo to jungles in Colombia, deserts in Africa, or perhaps remote islands in the Pacific Ocean. As it turned out for me, I got called to the Salt Lake City East mission in the heart of Utah. Ironically, I was in Salt Lake when I opened my mission call, in the same place where I would later spend 2 years.\nSo this post is for eager future missionaries who submitted their papers (like I once was) or for people who are interested in data behind where mormon missionaries are sent.\n\n\nData\nI spent a while digging around the internet, but was unable to find a publically accessible authoritative list of all missions. From this article, I know the most recent missions announced and the tota number of missions 450, but still could not find a complete list. So, I compiled the list they had on wikipedia which totalled 449 missions, so I guess I’m missing one mission somewhere though I don’t know which one.\nFrom this list of missions and regions, I imputed some data using the Gemini API (a few other data practitioners I follow have recently done this with success) like religions and languages in each mission. I also joined some regional population numbers to the data.\nI’ve included the data and my Rscript which can be downloaded on the side.\n\n\nCharts\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Mission Calls by Region\n\n\nLooking at this figure, almost 2 in 3 missionaries are called to somewhere in the Americas (assuming an equal number of missionaries per mission). The fewest missionaries are sent to Oceana, Europe, and Asia.\nI will say I theorize there is likely a strong interaction with where you go given your current citizenship. Missionaries are more likely to get called in their own nation than in another nation as the process is much more seamless and simple (and perhaps less costly). I’ll call this the citizenship interaction. But, ignoring this, the graph above shows the probabilities of going to each region.\nThe next figure compares the number of missionaries by the regional population.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Number of Persons per Missionary by Region\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRussia is included in Europe for this analysis.\n\n\nInterestingly in North America, there is a missionary for every 10,000 people. But, in Asia (even excluding china) there is only 1 missionary for every 420,000 people. This is a huge difference! Interestingly, South America is almost twice as saturated with missionaries per capita than Central America. There are also many more people than missionaries in Europe and Africa comparatively to other regions.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Probability of Stateside Call and Utah Call\n\n\nI know one of the big quesitons I had when getting a call was “What is my probability of going stateside in the US?” Well, our answer is ≈ 3 in 10 missionaries go to the US. I’m guessing that the citizenship interaction plays a role here, so US citizens are probably more likely to get called stateside than others.\nFor whatever reason, when I was a missionary in Utah, I used to tell people that 1 in 12 missionaries get called to Utah. It was just what I had heard passed around and what I told people I talked to. However, this is clearly quite wrong as only 1 in 33 go to Utah which is a few times less likely than I claimed.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Missions By Primary Language and Religion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThese figures are rounded, so 0% &lt; Hinduism &lt; 0.5%. But only a small region of the world is majority Hindu.\n\n\nAs a missionary, you are most likely to learn Spanish, Portuguese, or Filipino. You are also more likely to go to a Christian majority place.\nWhen I first saw this graph, I was confused as I thought that more religions would be represented in the graph. However, more research confirmed that this was indeed the case.\n\n\nConclusion\nThanks for reading though my post here. It actually took more time to compile this than I was anticipating, but I hope that it was informative for people. And, hopefully the extra information perhaps even helped calm a nervous future missionary waiting for their call.\n\n\nDiscussion\nWhat things most surprised you when reading?\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nIn October 2018, after some time of the “I am a Mormon” campaign, they pivoted to only wanting the church to be identified as “The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.” I wrote this post in curiosity of how well this change has been adopted by others - now having been almost 6 years since the announcement.\n\n\nData\nOne great source of data unmuddled by many biases that may exist in other sources is Google Trends. Google Search is not exclusively used (and perhaps used less now with LLMs), but a large percentage of Americans and world citizens for that matter use google and have used for some time. It is great at getting a sense of the relevance and use of words in near real time. This will be great for our purposes!\nPeople have written great books on findings from Google Trends (which I would recommend). You can see seasonal trends, growth and decline in words and phrasing, and even regional evidence of racism in the US - which may not be the regional division you expect.\n\n\nCharts\n\nHere you can see “Mormon church” in red and “The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints” in Blue. A few thoughts:\n\nFrom the announcement in October of 2018, you can see the terms has been immediately more used and the use seems to be growing over time.\nThe “Mormon church” search dropped a bit immediately, but has since recovered most if not all lost ground.\n“Mormon church” is still consistently used more, but its clear the gap has closed a bit since the announcement.\n\n\nIn the chart above, the yellow line represents the word “Mormon.” As you can see, “Mormon” is searched for much more often than both “Mormon Church” and “The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.” This term is most likely more helpful in discerning when the LDS church is in the news.\nCan you guess what the spike is in 2012? It’s when Mitt Romney ran for the US presidency. Despite the church spiking for being in the news here and again since, the overall search volume has decreased over time more recently. This trend was evident before the name change, but the search term volume has more or less flat-lined in the last year.\nThe largest recent spike in June of 2022 was driven by a popular TV show released called “Under the Banner of Heaven”. This was the biggest spike in about the last decade.\n\nWe’ve looked at some of the macro trends the past two decades, now lets look at some microtrends.\nThe chart above is the “Mormon” search term over the past 90 days. As you can see, every week it spikes - that is, every Sunday it spikes. Perhaps this is members finding a church building or something else. I’m honestly not certain.\nIf you are interested in the post, I encourage you to dig around on Google Trends. Perhaps you could find some interesting things I missed, or you could learn about a different topic altogether you’re interested in.\n\n\nAssumption Check\nIf you were to guess the largest recent spike for “Mormon” google search volume in the last decade, when would it be?\nI thought maybe ensign peaks, mormon murder suicides, or the AP article about bishops and abuse.\nNope, none of these made that much of a dent. The biggest spike in the last decade was from the netflix show Under the Banner of Heaven.\nTo me, the events listed above were big events that I perceived everyone talking about. But, in reality, these scandals didn’t draw eyes nationally. The moment when people started searching Mormonism is when a TV show came out on Netflix with a popular actor. My takeaway from this is that people in the US aren’t usually thinking about Mormons or Mormon happenings. In fact, they may think about Mormons as much as they think about carrots or viagra, but how much do people really think about those things? What I mean by all of this is big things that happen in Mormon land typically barely make a dent outside of the bubble. And, pretty much I just need to check and correct my assumptions about this.\n\n\nWeird Trivia Question\nWell, I was trying to find words that were searched in similar volume to “Mormon” and was just trying random words. Turns out, people search “Carrot” and “Viagra” at a similar volume. The graph in this tweet shows the search volume of “Mormon” vs. “Viagra” by state.\n\n\nHere's a fun trivia question: Q: Since 2004, have more people searched for \"Mormon\" or \"Viagra\"?A: Usually its Mormons, but there are a few special states#mormon #LDS pic.twitter.com/WEefHscQxW\n\n— mormon metrics (@mormon_metrics) June 22, 2024\n\n\nLet me know if you find other words that are searched in similar volume 😂\n\n\nDiscussion\nWhy has the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints not been talked about as much? Is this just gradual dropoff from the 2012 Romney spike or something else?\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus."
