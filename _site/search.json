    "text": "Purpose: To better inform the public - mormons and non-mormons alike - of mormon ideas, trends, and demographic movements backed with the best data available. Generally, I utilize quality survey datasets such as GSS, NationScape, and the CES. At times, I will also scrape data from public sources to find insights.\nThis information is diseminated in a weekly blog out on Friday mornings usually with a new data figure to talk about.\nAbout me: I am a social scientist and data scientist. I have an undergraduate degree in political science and a masters in data science. I have worked in the political polling industry and, most recently, the marketing data science field the past several years. You can read more about me on my personal website.\nTerminology: Some latter-day saints may be concerned because my title isn’t the correct name of the church. However, this blog is about the entirety of the Mormon sect including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Community of Christ, and others. So, in reference to the name of the sect, I use the name “Mormon” in my blog and hence the title “Mormon Metrics.”"

    "text": "Introduction\nRecently, I found myself reading a book by Jana Riess entitled The Next Mormons. It challenged some of my thoughts, and I generally found it interesting, so I wanted to share some thoughts here. Feel free to comment at the bottom of the page in the chat box and share your thoughts too (I just figured out how to add those to the bottom of my posts, so try it out!).\nThe premise of the book is describing findings from a survey of 1,156 Latter-day Saints and 540 former Latter-day Saints fielded September 8 - November 21, 2016 from an online panel (more methodology here if interested). I have shared data before from a more recent survey with Latter-day Saints, but this survey was unique because it was only a sample of Latter-day Saints and the survey questions were focused only on Latter-day Saints’ experiences and specifically Millennials (yeah I know… I found my niche truly as I am a survey-analyst, Millennial, Latter-day Saint). It reads very academic and summarizes both quantitative figures in charts and qualitative in-person interviews in the written text. Although the survey took place what is now almost 5 years ago, I find the content relevant and interesting now. So if the only church numbers you hear are from the Church Audit Report around General Conference time, you may be in the same place as I was."
