Generally, I utilize quality survey datasets such as GSS, NationScape, and the CES. At times, I will also scrape data from public sources to find insights.\nThis information is diseminated in a weekly blog out on Friday mornings usually with a new data figure to talk about.\nAbout me: I am a social scientist and data scientist. I have an undergraduate degree in political science and a masters in data science. I have worked in the political polling industry and, most recently, the marketing data science field the past several years. You can read more about me on my personal website.\nTerminology: Some latter-day saints may be concerned because my title isn’t the correct name of the church. However, this blog is about the entirety of the Mormon sect including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Community of Christ, and others. So, in reference to the name of the sect, I use the name “Mormon” in my blog and hence the title “Mormon Metrics.”"

    "text": "Introduction\nAs a member of the LDS church, I have grown up hearing the claim although US Latter-day Saints make up only a small percentage of the population, we are disproportionally wealthy when compared to the US general population. I assume this is a common misconception, given the amount of times I have heard it, as well as something I believed myself. At some point, I came across an article regarding Mormons in the US. I would just refer you to that article and you could be on your way, but the data is from 2009 - which is almost 15 years ago now! What a perfect opportunity for me to bake up some yummy data snacks regarding the breakdown of Latter-day Saints by household income and how it has changed over time.\n\n\nThe Data\nUsing data from a large political survey project of 500,000 Interviews from 2019-2021, I was able to filter the sample to only Latter-day Saint respondents and ended up with a sample 6,452 members found across the United States. I used the same data source as a previous blog post I wrote up here if interested.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this household income figure, we can answer our our first question! In 2021, the LDS actually has larger lower and middle classes and has a smaller proportion of people in the highest income bracket than the rest of the population. Hopefully, this is enough to convince you that Latter-day Saints being proportionally wealthier is a myth.\nI included Jews for the sake of including a group that actually is proportionally wealthy, and the gap is large. According to our data, the Jews are more than twice as likely to be in the top income bracket than Latter-day Saints.\nNow lets look at how this trend has changed over the last 15 years…\nOur data source we used above is only for 2019-21, so we need to combine another source for this next graph. Pew Research Center publishes a religous landscape study that collects large sample sizes of most religious groups in the United States. For Latter-day Saints, there is a sample of around 500 for this study which was fielded in 2007 and 2014. From this, we can look at 3 snapshots of LDS income over the last 15 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt definitely looks like income is increasing over time among Latter-day Saints. In the 100k+ group, we see 16% to 20% then 29%. However, this doesn’t account for forces like inflation and how the overall US population has moved over the last 15 years. So let’s make another one, to see how income has changed compared to the general population\nSide note about the above figure: I find it interesting that the proportion of LDS people in the lowest income bracket has remained relatively stable over time. While we don’t have the data we need to safely make this claim, our graph could suggest that there is a slight income disparity growing within the church as the middle income bracket shrinks over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking now at the Latter - day Saint group over time, the percentage of households making 100k+ consistently remains lower than the overall population. Also, it seems that the gap between the overall population and Latter - day Saints is growing over time. In 2007, there is a 6 point difference and goes from 6 to 8 to finally 11. Perhaps not only are Latter-day saints below the average, but may even be getting poorer over time!\nLatter-day Saints are not a poor group overall (30% make 6-figures+!), this information just disputes the claim that Latter-Day Saints are proportionally wealthy.\n\n\nAppendix\nThe code that I used to analyze this data and create the graphs above are found on github. Please reach out with any questions or thoughts.\nFor futher enrichment of those interested, here is the graph with several more religions.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, of the religions we included here, Mormons are the least likely to make $100k+.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus."

    "text": "Introduction\nI was curious how admission rates have changed over time, so I did a little digging to find out. I have always thought that BYU-Provo was the most difficult school to get into of the Mormon colleges, but I wanted to look at a few other schools to including BYU Hawaii and the eastern LDS-adjacent Southern Virginia University.\n\n\nData\nThe data in this post is from NCES which has a survey where US universities report data on various aspects of the college including admissions. If you explore the website, you can find numerous data sources about different aspects of the American education system from elementary school to high school and universities.\n\n\nChart\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Admission of LDS Colleges\n\n\nThough I would have loved to look back further, the NCES survey started recording admission data in 2014, so that’s what we have.\nA few findings…\n\nMore students are accepted into BYU-Provo now as compared to the past. In 2014, it was 50% and most recently is 67%.\nNumber of applicants to BYU-Idaho has increased over time though the acceptance rate has held constant.\nBYU-Hawaii accepts around the same amount of students each year, but the number that have applied has been a bit volatile in recent years.\nSVU has received a similar number of applicants over the years, but is now accepting almost all applicants compared to around 50% in 2014.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nHow does this track with what you have seen? Have you noticed more students getting in to BYU-Provo?\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus."
