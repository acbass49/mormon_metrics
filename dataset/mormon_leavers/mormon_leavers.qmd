#### Description

The Pew Research Center's 2014 Religious Landscape Study is a comprehensive survey of the religious affiliations, beliefs, and practices of over 35,000 adults in the United States. It found that the Christian share of the population is declining, while the religiously unaffiliated ("nones") are growing. The study also explored the diversity within religious groups, including differences in beliefs and practices.

In my analysis, I filtered this dataset to those who identified as Mormon or grew up Mormon (n=893)
