#### Description

I did an analysis here of dancing with the stars & utahns [here](https://mormonmetrics.substack.com/p/does-utah-actually-have-a-lot-of). There is no dataset (that I know of) that has this data. There was no place to scrape this - except going through manually of all known dancing with the stars professional dancers.

On the sidebar, I have provided the following resources:

1. `Data` - This is the dataset after manually gathering information for each professional dancer. Fields are `name`, `state/country`, `region`, `Followers` on instagram. Timestamp of this data is November 22, 2024.
