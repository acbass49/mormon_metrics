#### Description

LDS.org recently added a [statistics page](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/facts-and-statistics) which has various datapoints for world regions. I scraped this data on 23 of July 2024. I plan to scrape it again when it is updated each April conference. I used this data to create [this post](https://mormonmetrics.substack.com/p/which-states-have-the-most-mormons).

On the sidebar, I have provided the following resources:

1. `Data` - This is a link to take you to my github repository where I scraped this. It has my code and my data.

Must view this page on desktop - not mobile - to see the links.
