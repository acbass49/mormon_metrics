#### Description

I did an analysis here of all BYU vs. Utah football games [here](https://mormonmetrics.substack.com/p/byu-vs-utah). There is no dataset (that I know of) that has this data. So, I scraped it from [this site](https://byucougars.com/results).

On the sidebar, I have provided the following resources:

1. `Data` - This is the dataset after scraping it. It has every single BYU football game with the score and other meta data. The column names should be self explanatory.
