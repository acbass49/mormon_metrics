### Introduction

When I was 18 and graduating from high school, I remember feeling overwhelmed by the possible places you could go on a mission. After all, missionaries get called to every continent (except Antarctica) going anywhere from large cities like Tokyo to jungles in Colombia, deserts in Africa, or perhaps remote islands in the Pacific Ocean. As it turned out for me, I got called to the Salt Lake City East mission in the heart of Utah. Ironically, I was in Salt Lake when I opened my mission call, in the same place where I would later spend 2 years.

So this post is for eager future missionaries who submitted their papers or for people who are interested in data behind where mormon missionaries are sent.

### Data
I spent a while digging around the internet, but was unable to find a publically accessible authoritative list of all missions. From [this article](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/36-new-missions-church-of-jesus-christ), I know the most recent missions announced and the tota number of missions 450, but still could not find a complete list. So, I compiled the list they had on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_missions_of_the_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints) which totalled 449 missions, so I guess I'm missing one mission somewhere though I don't know which one.

From this list of missions and regions, I imputed some data using the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev) (a few other data practitioners I follow have recently done this with success) like religions and languages in each mission. I also joined [some regional population numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_continents_and_continental_subregions_by_population) to the data.

I've included the data and my Rscript which can be downloaded on the side.

### Charts

![Figure 1: Mission Calls by Region](mission_1.png)

Here are my takeaways from this chart:

- Overall US % married has decreased steadily since 1980 and % never married steadily increasing. This makes sense to me with [more people cohabitating](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/11/06/the-landscape-of-marriage-and-cohabitation-in-the-u-s/).
- For Mormons, the each line has stayed quite flat and more or less remained unchanged the last 40 years. The Mormons today may look like over American families did 40 years ago. This is quite interesting as the US population has had many shifts on views of marriage during that this time period, but Mormons may not have been as affected or changed by these.
- Compared to the US population, Mormons are more likely to be married (especially more recently) and less likely to be "never married" or "widowed/divorced/separated."

### Discussion

In your opinion, why have Mormon demographics of marriage hardly changed over the last 40 years?
