### Introduction

I've been seeing a few places that the perception is that Mormons have a large middle class group ["with above average education levels"](https://www.americansurveycenter.org/newsletter/trumps-problem-with-mormon-voters-is-getting-worse/), but after seeing some income data from Nationscape I was curious what nationscape data had for Mormon education levels. 

### Data
The data in this post is from the [Nationscape](https://www.voterstudygroup.org/nationscape) which has data from 2019-2021. Because of the large sample sizes of the project, we are able to get a several thousand LDS respondents (6452 to be exact) which is significantly better than things like the religious landscape study by [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/religious-landscape-study/database/). But, lets see what it says...

### Charts

What AEI reports makes sense when you look at some of the Pew Research data. In 2009, they published a [Mormon Profile](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2009/07/24/a-portrait-of-mormons-in-the-us/#:~:text=Mormons%20are%20significantly%20more%20likely,to%20have%20some%20college%20education.) describing high level demographic information. Here is the education figure from that report:

![Figure 1: Mormon Education Levels from 2009 (Pew)](https://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2012/07/Mormons6.gif)

At this time, we see a lot more "some college" mormons than are in the general population and even slightly more mormons with a college degree. This information tracks with what AEI reported.

![Figure 2: Overall Education Levels with Nationscape](chart4-1.png)

First of all, let's remember our sample size with Pew is just over 500 compared to our nationscape sample which is more than 10x this. Obviously, more data will cut down our confidence intervals significantly.

We still see a larger "some college" group among mormons compared to national numbers, but fewer people getting bachelor's and graduate degrees and a large HS or less group. It's possible this could be a trend where initially (2009) mormons were more educated and had more money, but recently have more members in the middle class(2022).

![Figure 3: Education X Gender with Nationscape](Chart_4.png)

Looking specifically at the gender cut, unsurprisingly, the some college group is driven by women who prehaps dropped out of college after having children. As is the trend with the national, Mormon women are a bit more likely to be educated beyond high school than Mormon men.

But, overall, Mormons don't appear to be as educated as the average american with slightly more people not attending college. This isn't a large gap as the majority of Mormon's attend some college, but again, so do most people in the American population.

This finding isn't absolute and concrete of course as this deals with internet panel survey sampling where error exists, so I look forward to confirm this with other data sources in the future.

### Discussion

Did you have the perception that American Mormons were more educated than the average American?
