### Introduction

Recently, a few articles have come out about how Mormons are less favorable toward Donald Trump than previous Republican candidates. Specifically, they say [the distaste still lingers here in 2024](https://www.americansurveycenter.org/newsletter/trumps-problem-with-mormon-voters-is-getting-worse/) and [younger Mormons may be moving away more quickly than other younger folks](https://www.graphsaboutreligion.com/p/young-mormons-are-abandoning-the). Lets look at some of these trends to see what's happening with Mormon political affiliation.

### Data
The data in this post is from the [GSS](https://gss.norc.org) which has data from 1978 to present. Unfortunately, due to the limited sample size of the GSS (having a few thousand respondents each wave), it can be difficult to see trends. For this chart, I combined the data by decade to try and see a trend. Each data point for mormons represent around 150-200 people, but it should be interpreted with caution as the respondents are spread out over a decade after all. The hope is that we will be able to see large shifts and trends for our question. Perhaps at a later date, I will use the [CES](https://cces.gov.harvard.edu) data which has larger samples to look closer at some of these trends.

### Chart

Let's talk about some takeaways looking at our chart...

- In the US overall, the number of true independents has increased ~7 percentage points since the 1980s taking from the Democratic party.
- For Mormons, we see a similar trend with true independents increasing; however, Mormons who previously identified with both parties are leaving it seems.
- If you look closely, **you can see that Republicans are leaving at a twice the rate (-23pts) than Democrats(-12pts) since the 80s** which supports some of the claims in the articles mentioned above.

Though, it is important to remember to interpret these with caution as these Mormon datapoints are being combined over a decade with only ~ 175 people for each data point. 

### Discussion

Why are more people identifying as independents? Why could this trend be especially pronounced among Mormons?
